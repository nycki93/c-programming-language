/* Exercise 1-21. Write a program 'entab' that replaces strings of
 * blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same
 * spacing. Use the same tab stops as for 'detab'. When either a tab
 * or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be
 * given preference? */

/* <nupa> In response to the open-ended part of the question, I think
 * a 1-width tab should be given priority over a lone space, but only
 * at the start of a line (implying TAB_WIDTH = 1). In all other 
 * situations, a 1-width tab should not appear.
 * 
 * Exercise for future me: Heuristically handle mixed indentation and 
 * alignment by comparing the space width to the previous line ;) */
